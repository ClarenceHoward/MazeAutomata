#  Maze Generating Cellular Automata

This is an implementation of maze generating cellular automata based on the rules described in [this paper](https://justinparrtech.com/JustinParr-Tech/wp-content/uploads/Creating%20Mazes%20Using%20Cellular%20Automata_v2.pdf). It has adjustable parameters for the branching and turn frequency of the automata that generate the maze. Adjusting the frequency will change the style of the maze. 

It is still a work in progress and there are some small bugs.

## Attribution

I used the library [GraphLib](https://github.com/dagrejs/graphlib) to create the graph that represents the maze.

## Installation

Open **MazeAutomata.html** in a browser of your choice.
